I've thoroughly reviewed the `App.js` code you provided. You're right, there were several syntax issues that were causing the build to fail. The "Unexpected token" error typically means that a character or structure isn't where the JavaScript parser expects it, often due to a missing bracket or parenthesis.

I've identified and fixed multiple issues, mainly concentrated in these areas:

1.  **Missing `}` in `strategicPlan` definition:** There was an extra `}` that prematurely closed the `strategicPlan` array, which was likely the cause of the initial "Unexpected token" error affecting subsequent lines.
2.  **Syntax Errors in `InitiativeDetailModal`:**
    * Missing `<Info />` self-closing tag.
    * Incorrect conditional rendering for `initiative.department` and its wrapping paragraph `<p>` tag.
    * Incorrect string interpolation for `className` in the status `<span>` tag (missing backticks `` ` ``).
    * Missing `li` tags around the mapped milestones.
    * Missing closing `</button>` and `</div>` tags in several places, making the JSX invalid.
3.  **Syntax Error in `escapeCsvField` function:**
    * The string interpolation for the CSV field was incorrect (using `"${...}"` instead of backticks `` `${...}` ``).
4.  **Syntax Error in `TimelineBar`'s `parseTimelineRange` function:** An extra closing curly brace `}` was found.
5.  **Syntax Error in inline `<style>` block:** The `@media print` CSS block was not correctly wrapped for JSX rendering.

I have corrected all these issues. Please replace the *entire content* of your `src/App.js` file with the corrected code provided below.
